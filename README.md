# +Roam Alfred Workflow

This [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) workflow is based on [+Roam](https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-bookmarklet)
but is adapted for use as an Alfred workflow targeting Safari.

## What does this do?

After installation, the `ctrl+r` hotkey (when Safari is the active window) will take your current selection,
format it in a way that [Roam](http://roamresearch.com) understands, copy it to your clipboard, and
switch to the [Roam](http://roamresearch.com) desktop application where you can paste it in a location
that makes sense for you. A notification will show the title of the page to visually confirm that the workflow
is doing what it is supposed to.

## Installation

Simply download the [workflow](https://github.com/dnjp/roam-alfred/blob/main/%2BRoam%20Clipboard.alfredworkflow)
and open it in [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) where you can configure the workflow to your taste.
